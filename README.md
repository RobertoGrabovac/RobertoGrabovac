### Profile
I am a final-year graduate student majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics at the [Faculty of Science](https://www.pmf.unizg.hr/math/en), University of Zagreb, currently working as a Data Scientist Intern at [Infobip](https://www.infobip.com/). My primary areas of interest include Machine Learning and Mathematical Statistics, which I have deeply explored and am passionate about. Additionally, I maintain keen interests in both web and game development, complementing my expertise in theoretical computer science areas such as Mathematical Logic, Computability, and Compiler Theory.
